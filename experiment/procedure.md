### Procedure

1. **Setup the Simulation:**
   - Open the simulation interface in a browser.

2. **Configure the Parameters:**
   - **Set the Number of Processes:**
     - Locate the "Number of processes" field in the controls section.
     - Enter the desired number of processes (minimum 3, maximum 20). The default value is 5.
   - **Choose the Objective:**
     - Open the dropdown menu labeled "Objective."
     - Select one of the available objectives, such as:
       - *Just exploring*: No specific goal; observe the behavior.
       - *Force consensus to run for at least 2 rounds* (default).
     - Note that some objectives are locked initially, and can be unlocked by achieving objectives.

3. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Click the **Start simulation** button to begin.
   - Observe the consensus process in the display canvas.

4. **Repeat for Additional Objectives:**
   - Adjust the number of processes or select a different objective, and restart the simulation to explore various scenarios.
